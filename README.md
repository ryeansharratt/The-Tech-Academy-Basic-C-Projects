# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Projects.

This is where my projects from The Tech Academy's C# course can be found!

## Main Projects:

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/ryeansharratt/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
* [School Database](https://github.com/ryeansharratt/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Projects/tree/main/StudentDBProject)

### Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page to view all insured clients and the quotes they've been issued.

### School Database

This is a data visualization app for a school that is meant to store and display student information, including grades. It is an app that utilizes Entity Framework for data access and a Code-First workflow approach. This is still a WIP.
